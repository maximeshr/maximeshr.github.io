Hey guys! Today is a interesting day ;)  
I've met an interesting company (startup-like) looking for a good JS developer: [Qualifio](http://www.qualifio.com/).

They work with Node.js / AngularJS and more interesting, with ES6 through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Thats so cool because, here in Belgium, the Node.js missions are really uncommon… Did I mention that they work Agile? #happy #developer

For those like me using CoffeeScript, here is an interesting [guide](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/replace-coffeescript-with-es6) to switch to ES6.

If like me you wanna learn ES6, here some interesting links to boost your <strike>rookie</strike> skill:

  - [Eric Douglas Guide](https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning) __(best ressource)__
  - [Exploring ES6 Online Book](http://exploringjs.com/)
  - [Interesting ES6 Playlist on YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEKIsm9AjY8LfH5cYnhJE-L5A7NWis6qB) __(JSBroadcast)__

I hope you'll enjoy these ressources ;)

See you next time…
