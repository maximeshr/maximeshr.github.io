Hi guys! I'm so excited because, first of all, it's my first post in english since long time. I apologize for any orthographic mistake in these posts. English is not my mother tongue but I hope it will be nice to be read :)

Second, I will write posts about a cool technologie that I wanna learn since months : [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). The global goal is to master it after seven weeks of intensive learning. By intensive, I mean learning everyday. The optional goal is to have more reader and maybe some [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) jobs (as freelance)

After these weeks, I wanna build a powerful parsing application using what I've learned.

Why seven weeks? Because in seven weeks, it's my birthday. What is the best gift that mastering [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)!

About frequency, I think one or two posts each week is nice for you and for me...

OK, that's all for today, cya soon!
